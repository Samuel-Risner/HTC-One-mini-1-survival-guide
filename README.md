## 2. Device Setup

In this section I'll just asume that you're starting on a fresh install and/or have reset your phone.

### 2.1. Things That You Will Need

- WIFI access and password
- a Google account

### 2.2. When Going Through Startup

## 3. Installing The Play Store App

### 3.1. Get The APK File

When trying to do anything with the already installed Play Store app nothing would work, I would just get connection errors. To be able to use the Play Store app and through that basically the whole phone I installed another Play Store version to replace the current one.

I got the APK file from APKMirror: https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/google-play-store/google-play-store-33-1-16-release/google-play-store-33-1-16-19-0-pr-487270566-android-apk-download/

That version seemed to be the newest one that was also compatible with Android 4.4.2.

### 3.2. Install It

To install it I first mailed the link to the email with which I was signed in and opened the link.

NOTE: I did not open the link with Google Chrome since Cloudflare would complain about the Chrome Version being to old. Insted I used the "Internet" app. When clicking on the download button nothing happens, insted you have to click the "If the download didn't start autamatically click here" button.

The APK file should be available in the "Downloads" app but the installation window should pop up on its own.

The install the new Play Store simply click through all the stuff and wait a little bit (2-3 minutes) for it to install.

You should be ready to go!

### 3.3. Other Notes

Sadly not every app will work. Here are some lists of apps that work and those that don't:

#### 3.3.1. APPs That Work:

- Smash Hit
- Google
- Google Chrome: Fast & Secure

#### 3.3.2. APPs That Don't Work (But You Can Still Install Them):

- MANGA PLUS by SHUEISHA
- Orbot: Tor for Android

## 4. APPs That Can Be Uninstalled

The Android comes with a lot of extra apps installed, some of them can be removed or disabled because they aren't supported anymore.

To uninstall or disbale apps got to: Settings > Apps and select "All"

### 4.1. APPS That Can Be Disabled:

When disabling apps you can "Force Stop" them, "Disable" them and also use "Clear data", "Clear cache" and "Clear defaults".

Google+ is not available to normal users anymore:
- Google+
- Google+ for HTC Sense

- Facebook (You can also unisnatll it.)
- Facebook for HTC Sense (! You can't disable this one.)
- Instagram for HTC Sense
- Hangouts
- LinkedIn for HTC Sense
- Pinterest (You can slo unisnatll this.)

# 5. Qualtity Of Life Stuff

## 5.1. Vibrating When You Press Stuff

To stop the three buttons on the display and the refreshing sound from vibrating:

Settings > Sound > under "SYSTEM" > you can basically uncheck everything

Stop the keyboard from vibrating:

Settings > Language & Keyboard > HTC Sense Input > uncheck "Vibration feedback"
